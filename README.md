An application that will help travelers to navigate more easily through a complicated system of subway lines.
Two algorithms are used:
 - Breadth-First search to find the shortest (the smallest number of stations) way from one point to another;
 - Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest route considerign the time between the stations and time for transfer from one line to another.
